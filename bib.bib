  abstract = {Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is a method for modeling whole sets of complex interrelations between observed and/or latent variables. In its most common form, SEM combines confirmatory factor analysis (CFA with another method named path analysis). Just like CFA, SEM relates observed variables to latent variables that are measured by those observed variables and, as path analysis does, SEM allows for a wide range of regression-type relations between sets of variables (both latent and observed). This chapter presents an introduction to SEM, an integrated strategy for conducting SEM analysis that is well-suited for educational sciences, and a tutorial on how to carry out an SEM analysis in R.},

  abstract = {Researchers in educational psychology have researched Teacher Self-Concept (TSC) and Teacher Efficacy (TE) as two main predictors predicting burnout. Guided by a model developed by Zhu, Liu, Fu, Yang, Zhang \& Shi (2018), the researchers aimed at building a model involving TSC, TE, and three components of burnout; Emotional Exhaustion (EE), Depersonalization (DP), and Reduced Personal Accomplishment (RPA) through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The researchers investigated predicting factors of burnout by reporting TSC and TE that might directly affect the components and examine the probability of TE to become a mediator of the correlation between TSC and burnout. This research also examined whether the difference emerges constantly among demographic information (gender and teaching experience) regarding all involved variables. A sample of 876 teachers across three Indonesian provinces completed a printed form of questionnaires. Some statistical procedures namely Content Validity Index (CVI), Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modeling (CB-SEM), and t-test were conducted. Findings informed that the model is valid and reliable. TSC could directly affect EE, DE, and RPA, as well as indirectly influence them mediated by TE. Besides, TE is also reported to have significant relationships with EE, DE, and RPA. No significant differences in terms of age and teaching experiences emerge, except for EE.},
